%% BASIC example 1
% call the function with empty inputs, and it should create the plot with
% the focus on the test track, satellite view
fcn_PlotTestTrack_geoPlotData;

%% BASIC example 2
% call the function with empty inputs, but with a figure number,
% and it should create the plot with
% the focus on the test track, satellite view
% fcn_PlotTestTrack_geoPlotData((data_array),(color),(text),(fig_num))
data_array = []; % Make it empty to NOT plot data
plot_color = []; % Make it empty to use default

fig_num = 222; % Give a figure number to make it plot it the figure
fcn_PlotTestTrack_geoPlotData(data_array,plot_color,plot_text,fig_num);

%% BASIC example 3
% Plot data onto an empty figure. This will force the code to check to see
% if the figure has data inside it, and if not, it will prepare the figure
% the same way as a new figure.


% Fill in some dummy data (East curve from scenario 1_1)
